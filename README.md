# ⏱️ **Pomodoro Timer**

A simple and stylish **Pomodoro Timer** app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app helps users implement the **Pomodoro Technique** for time management.

## 📚 **About the Pomodoro Technique**

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks (usually 5 minutes). After four "Pomodoros," you take a longer break (15-30 minutes). 

The idea is to enhance focus and productivity by working in short, intense bursts with frequent breaks to avoid burnout.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the timer and implementing the light/dark theme switcher. Used **Flexbox** for layout and positioning, and custom styles for the toggle switch.
- **JavaScript**: For the interactive logic, including the Pomodoro timer functionality (start, pause, reset), light/dark mode toggle, and session transitions.

## 📝 **How It Works**

### **Timer Functionality**
The timer runs in **25-minute intervals** for work, followed by **5-minute short breaks**, and a longer **15-minute break** after four work sessions. The JavaScript code controls the timer countdown, updating the UI every second.

### **Light/Dark Mode**
The app has a **Light/Dark Mode** toggle implemented using JavaScript and CSS. The user can toggle between the modes to suit their preferences. This feature improves accessibility and allows users to switch based on their environment or personal preference.

### **Responsive Design**
The app is built with a **responsive layout** using **Flexbox**, so it works seamlessly across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
